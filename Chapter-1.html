      <p> <b class="first-words">A QUICK</b> question: What do you think the purpose of this book is?</p>
      <div class="chapter-section">
      <p>It's a simple question, and I ask a similar one at seminars around the world: What's the purpose of our time here today?</p>
      <p>So what is it? After all, I know <em>why</em> you picked up this book- it's because something is wrong. Now I want to know how you think this book will help. What's its purpose? What do you expect from it?</p>
      <p>If you're like most first-time participants in one of our training events (the veterans know better), you answer will likely be: To learn something. It's a natural response-most people think that the purpose of a book or a seminar is to learn something. To gain knowledge.</p>
      <p>Well, most people are wrong.</p>
      <p>The vast majority of what happens in great seminars, and in great books, is unlearning. Those <em>aha!</em> moments you feel in a great training program or during a particularly enlightening pasage of a book? They don't happen becasue you learned something. They happen because you <em>un</em>learned-that flash of insight was realizing that something you thought you knew just wasn't true.</p>
      <p>I'm not talking about unlearning facts.Discovering that a tomato is a fruit and not a vegetable won't change your life much. The unlearning that matters for your pivot is much deeper. It's not about changing your knowledge. </p>
      <p>It's about changing your beliefs.</p>
